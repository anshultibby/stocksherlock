# StockSherlock
  Stock Sherlock processes stock .xml files using NASDAQ Data On Demand API and converts them into numpy arrays to analyze data. The raw data is then modeled under our metrics: Variability Mean, Growth Rate, Volume Mean, Volume Spread, and Risk. This data is converted into a .csv file that IBM Watson's Tradeoff Analytics API displays in a stock comparison visualization tool. 
  
  1. Run server.py in stockBrowser. 
  2. Select stocks to be filtered by NASDAQ API.
  3. Give IBM Watson .csv file produced by stockBrowser
  4. Adjust scales and compare.
